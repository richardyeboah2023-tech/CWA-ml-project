# CWA ML Project

## Overview
This project predicts a student's academic performance (CWA) using
machine learning and integrates a C backend for fast numerical computation.

## Architecture
- Python: GUI, data processing, ML models
- C: High-performance numerical computation
- GUI: Tkinter-based interface

## Workflow
1. User inputs academic data through GUI
2. Python ML model predicts performance
3. C library performs optimized computation
4. Results are displayed in the GUI

## Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, scikit-learn, Tkinter)
- C (compiled as shared library)
- Git & GitHub
