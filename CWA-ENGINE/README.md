# CWA-ENGINE
A **C-based backend engine** for computing Cumulative Weighted Average (CWA) and Weighted Average (WA) for students.  
This library handles all core calculations while Python (or any frontend) can handle file input, visualization, and user interface.

---

## Features

- Compute required scores to reach a **target CWA**
- Recalculate scores when **priority course grades** are set
- Stateless, fast, and lightweight
- Encapsulated design with **public API only**
- Easy to integrate with Python (or other languages) for front-end/visualization

Note: Windows users need MinGW or a similar GCC environment installed       to run the makefile.
